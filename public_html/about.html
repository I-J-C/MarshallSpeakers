                    The heavy sound of Marshall has been carried over the world for half a century. Breathless roadies and roaring trucks have worked hard to make Marshall heard all across the globe. Now, the time has come for you to carry this magnificent burden of rock ‘n’ roll all by yourself. Spending half a century on tour with the most prominent and untamed musicians builds experience and a feel for what really works. This unparalleled amount of wisdom has been distilled and fused into every part of Marshall speakers. Nothing has been compromised when expanding the Marshall heritage of big stage performance to the individual enjoyment of good music.

                <p class="one">Marshall is a true rock legend. That uniquely clear and expressive sound combined with a mythical stage presence has enraptured music fans around the world for five decades. We’re celebrating our brand’s rich heritage with commemorative products that live and breathe Marshall.</p>

                <p class="one">The legacy begins in a small drum shop in Hanwell in the 1960s, where Jim Marshall sought to give a bunch of then-local guitarists the sound they wanted – a sound that was harder, crunchier and more rich. The result was the JTM45, an amp that reverberated with a sound that was much heavier than anything ever heard before. And in a twist of rock and roll fate – those guitarists, much like the Marshall name, would go on to revolutionize music forever. </p>

            <div class="amp"></div>
            <div class="p3">
                <p class="two">Fifty years on, generations of guitarists and fans still revere the name.  Since that very first amp, Marshall continues to push the boundaries of loud into the unknown, bringing the stadium experience home to the individual listener.</p>

                <p class="two">Rock ‘n’ roll has created the world and no brand has shaped rock ‘n’ roll more than Marshall. Like all supreme forms of life, rock ‘n’ roll and Marshall rests on top of creation not as a result of conscious calculation but has gained their symbiotic power by trusting instincts, being unpredictable and keeping both ears open.</p>
